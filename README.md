# mobile

The main goal of this project is to develop a mobile application that allows an administrator to view and analyze data related to their work or business.
The app will provide a user-friendly interface that presents information in a visually appealing way, using graphs and other visual aids to make it 
easy for the user to understand trends and patterns in the data.

The app will be designed to collect and display data from various sources, such as user interactions with the app 
or other relevant metrics. The data will be presented in real-time or near real-time, allowing the administrator to make decisions based on 
up-to-date information.

Overall, the main goal of the app is to provide an easy-to-use, intuitive interface that helps the administrator quickly and easily understand their 
data and make informed decisions based on that data. The app will be designed with scalability in mind, so that it can accommodate a growing 
volume of data and users as the business or organization expands.
